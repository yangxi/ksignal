# Intro
This kernel module exports physical memory addresses of SHIM kernel signals from where user level profilers can continuously sample kernel signals.
To generate SHIM signals, patch Linux 4.18 with the ksignal-linux4.18.patch patch in this repo that generates schedule, wakeup, softirq, pagefault, systemcall, tcp recv, tcp xmit signals.

# Usage
Make sure you turn on this flag "CONFIG_DEVMEM=y" when building the Linux kernel, because you need to mmap the kernel memory space to the user space via "/dev/mem". This patch is a hack, just for demonstrating the research idea.

# Usage
"make; sudo insmod ksignal.ko;" loads this module. It creates the file "/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/signal_page" that shows physical addresses of the SHIM signals, the file "/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/task_signal" that shows physical addresses of the current running task signals, and the file "/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/flag_signal" that shows physical addresses of the Elfen nanonap addresses.

"make user" generates "read_signal_page" which demonstrates how to map SHIM signals to user space and read the signals, and "sample_ksignal" that shows how to map current task signals to the suer space and read current tasks running on all CPUs.
