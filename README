# Intro

This Linux kernel module exports physical memory addresses of the kernel per-CPU SHIM probes. Kernel writes signals to the SHIM probes. From the probes, user-level observer is able to read the kernel signals and correlate the kernel signals with other user-level signals.

The ksignal-linux4.18.patch generates schedule, wakeup, softirq, pagefault, systemcall, tcp recv, tcp xmit signals.
Make sure you turn on this flag "CONFIG_DEVMEM=y", because you need to mmap the kernel memory space to the user space via "/dev/mem". This patch is a hack, just for demonstrating the research idea.

# Usage

"make; sudo insmod ksignal.ko;" loads this module. It creates one file "/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/signal_page" that has the physical addresses of the SHIM probes.

"make user" generates "read_signal_page" which demonstrates how to map the probe addresses to user space and read the signals.
